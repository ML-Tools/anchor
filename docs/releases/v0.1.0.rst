v0.1.0 (July 14, 2016)
-------------------------

This is the first official release of ``anchor``! This is known as ``anchor-bio`` on PyPI

Anchor is a program to classify alternative splicing events (or any values
ranging from 0 to 1) into "modes", such as "unimodal", "bimodal"

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Calcluating modality
====================

Given ``splicing`` is a ``pandas.DataFrame`` formatted where the rows are the
samples and the columns are the features, so the shape is
``(n_samples, n_features))``, the following code will calculate modalities on
each column (splicing event):

.. code-block::

    import anchor

    bm = anchor.BayesianModalities()
    modalities = bm.fit_transform(splicing)

Which you can turn into a tidy dataframe:

.. code-block::

    modalities_tidy = modalities.unstack().reset_index()
    modalities_tidy = modalities_tidy.rename(columns={'index':'event_id', 0:'modality'})
    modalities_tidy = modalities_tidy.dropna()
    print(modalities_tidy.shape)
    modalities_tidy.head()

Plotting colors
===============

Anchor provides helpful tools for plotting modalities using ``seaborn``-based
functions.

.. code-block::

    from anchor import MODALITY_ORDER, MODALITY_PALETTE, MODALITY_TO_COLOR
