v0.1.0 (July 14, 2016)
-------------------------

This is the first official release of ``anchor``! This is known as ``anchor-bio`` on PyPI

Anchor is a program to classify alternative splicing events (or any values
ranging from 0 to 1) into "modes", such as "unimodal", "bimodal"

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Given ``splicing`` is a ``pandas.DataFrame`` formatted where the rows are the
samples and the columns are the features, so the shape is
``(n_samples, n_features))``, the following code will calculate modalities on
each column (splicing event):

.. code-block::

    import anchor

    bm = anchor.BayesianModalities()
    modalities = bm.fit_transform(splicing)
